Just mucking about with functions and first derivatives trying to remember some basic calculus. Function and derivative are hardcoded, but if you change them both correctly (and the wavelength) it should still work. The red line is tangent to the curve, and the blue line is normal to the curve. Vectors follow the mouse's x position.
